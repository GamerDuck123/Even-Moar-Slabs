# Even-Moar-Slabs

## What is this?
Even Moar Slabs is a mod that tries to add as many slabs, stairs, and walls into the game as possible, we try to achieve this by auto generating all the textures, and models for each block in the game, and compiling them into usable blocks! This includes the ability to craft, and use them!

## How many slabs/stairs/walls are there?
Currently there are a little bit more than 820 slabs, stairs and walls, this number is subject to change as we figure out how to import more and more items into proper models!

## Why are some missing textures?
Some blocks are missing textures due to the fact I have not yet figured out a way to handle multi sided textures (like logs) where each side has a different texture, this will be fixed in the next update!
